# Security Overhaul Plan

Comprehensive, severity-ordered plan for hardening the Polarsteps Album Generator
for public deployment on a cloud VM. Every item is numbered. Items are grouped by
severity and ordered within each group by blast radius and ease of exploitation.

Goal: withstand automated scanners, bots, and casual attackers ("script kiddies")
without needing enterprise infrastructure.

---

## CRITICAL

### 1. ~~Authentication: signed, expiring session cookie~~ DONE

**Implemented:** Replaced the raw-integer cookie with Google OAuth2 +
Starlette `SessionMiddleware`. The session cookie is now:

- **Signed** via `itsdangerous.TimestampSigner` (Starlette's SessionMiddleware
  uses `SECRET_KEY` to sign the cookie payload).
- **Expires** after 30 days (`max_age=30 * 86400`).
- **httponly, SameSite=lax** — set by SessionMiddleware.
- **Secure** in non-local environments (`https_only=settings.ENVIRONMENT != "local"`).
- **Generic name** (`"session"`) — does not leak implementation details.
- **No PII stored** — only `{"uid": <int>}` in the signed cookie payload.

Authentication flow:
1. User signs in with Google (client-side Google Identity Services).
2. Backend verifies the Google JWT via `pyjwt` + Google's JWKS endpoint.
3. Existing user: sets `request.session["uid"]` → signed cookie returned.
4. New user: returns `null`, frontend holds credential in `sessionStorage`.
5. Upload: re-verifies JWT at upload time, creates user atomically.

Session fixation prevention: `request.session.clear()` is called before
setting `uid` in both `auth.py` and `users.py`.

**Files:** `main.py` (SessionMiddleware), `deps.py` (reads `request.session`),
`auth.py` (Google JWT verification + session creation), `users.py` (upload +
session creation for new users).

---

### 2. ~~Upload size limit~~ DONE

**Implemented:** Upload size limit enforced at three layers, configurable via
`VITE_MAX_UPLOAD_GB` env var (default: 4). Single source of truth in `.env`.

1. **Frontend** — Quasar `q-uploader` rejects files exceeding the limit before
   upload starts (`max-file-size` prop). User sees a localized "file too large"
   toast with the configured limit.
2. **Nginx** — `client_max_body_size 4g` rejects oversized requests with 413
   before any bytes reach the backend. `client_body_timeout 300s` kills
   slow-upload (Slowloris-style) connections.
3. **Backend** — `_check_upload_size()` in `users.py` verifies actual file
   size via seek before extraction begins (defense-in-depth).

**Files:** `.env` (`VITE_MAX_UPLOAD_GB`), `config.py` (Settings field),
`upload.py` (`MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` derived from settings), `users.py` (size check),
`ZipUploader.vue` (frontend limit), `nginx.conf` (network limit),
`Dockerfile` + `compose.yml` (build arg passthrough).

Storage protection is handled separately by item #13 (per-user storage quota)
and item #3 (rate limiting) — not by the upload size limit.

---

### 3. ~~Rate limiting: nginx~~ DONE

**Implemented:** Nginx rate limiting with two per-IP zones:

- **`uploads` zone** (1 req/min, burst 2) — applied to
  `location = /api/v1/users/upload`. Prevents upload abuse (ZIP extraction,
  disk writes, ffprobe/ffmpeg/Pillow processing are expensive).
- **`general` zone** (10 req/s, burst 30) — applied to `location /api/`.
  Blocks automated floods before they reach Python.

Both zones return **429** when the limit is exceeded. Static assets
(`/assets/`, `/`) have no rate limit.

Also added `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` proxy headers
(completes the nginx side of item #8).

**Files:** `frontend/nginx/nginx.conf`

---

## HIGH

### 4. ~~Nginx security headers~~ DONE

**Implemented:** All security headers in a shared `security-headers.conf`
snippet, included at server level (inherited by API locations) and explicitly
in `/assets/` and `/` locations (which have their own `add_header`, overriding
nginx's inheritance).

Headers:
- `server_tokens off` — hides nginx version
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — prevents MIME sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` — prevents clickjacking
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` — disables camera, microphone, geolocation
- `Content-Security-Policy` — whitelists only required external resources:
  Google Sign-In (script, frame, connect, img), Mapbox (tiles, API, workers,
  RTL text plugin), flagcdn (country flag images)

**Files:** `frontend/nginx/security-headers.conf`, `frontend/nginx/nginx.conf`,
`frontend/Dockerfile`

---

### 5. ~~Containers run as root~~ DONE

**Implemented:**

**Backend** — `appuser` (non-root) created after Playwright install (which
needs root for system packages). `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/app/browsers`
ensures the browser binary is accessible to the non-root user. Data directory
(`/app/backend/data`) owned by `appuser`. Chromium launched with `--no-sandbox`
since the container itself is the sandbox (item #28).

**Frontend** — Entire nginx process runs as the `nginx` user (non-root).
Switched from port 80 to 8080 (non-root can't bind privileged ports).
Writable directories (`/var/cache/nginx`, `/var/log/nginx`, `/run`) owned
by `nginx`.

Note: If upgrading from a previous deployment, the `app-data` Docker volume
may still be owned by root. Fix with:
`docker compose exec backend chown -R appuser:appuser /app/backend/data`

**Files:** `backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/Dockerfile`,
`frontend/nginx/nginx.conf` (port 8080), `compose.override.yml` (dev port),
`backend/app/main.py` (`--no-sandbox`)

---

### 6. ~~MIME type validation on upload~~ DONE

**Implemented:** Two-layer magic byte validation using `puremagic` (pure Python,
no system dependencies):

1. **Before extraction** — first 2048 bytes checked against
   `{"application/zip", "application/x-zip-compressed"}`. Rejects non-ZIP
   uploads before any disk I/O.
2. **After extraction** — every extracted file checked against
   `{"image/jpeg", "video/mp4", "application/json", "text/plain"}`. Rejects
   ZIPs containing executables, scripts, HTML, or other unexpected types.

Used `puremagic` instead of `python-magic` — zero system dependencies (no
`libmagic1` needed), pure Python, actively maintained.

**File:** `backend/app/logic/upload.py`

---

### 7. ~~Docker Compose: security_opt, cap_drop, resource limits~~ DONE

**Implemented:** All four services hardened in `compose.yml`:

- **`no-new-privileges:true`** on all services — blocks setuid-based privilege
  escalation.
- **`cap_drop: [ALL]`** on all services — zero default Linux capabilities.
  Only `db` gets `cap_add: [CHOWN, FOWNER, SETGID, SETUID]` (needed by
  postgres entrypoint for `chown`/`gosu`). Backend, frontend, and prestart
  need zero capabilities.
- **`read_only: true`** on all services — immutable root filesystem. Writable
  paths via `tmpfs` (`/tmp`, `/var/run/postgresql`, `/var/cache/nginx`) and
  existing named volumes (`app-data`, `db-data`).
- **Resource limits** — memory and CPU per service via `deploy.resources.limits`.
- **`pids_limit`** — fork bomb protection per service.
- **`shm_size: 256m`** on backend — Chromium needs shared memory for rendering
  (Docker default 64MB is too small).
- **`init: true`** on backend — proper zombie process reaping for ffmpeg and
  Chromium subprocesses.
- **nginx tmpfs** uses `uid=101,gid=101` so the non-root `nginx` user can write
  to cache/run directories.

**File:** `compose.yml`

---

### 8. ~~Proxy headers for real client IP~~ DONE

**Implemented:**

- Uvicorn: `--proxy-headers` flag in both `Dockerfile` and `compose.override.yml`.
- Nginx: `X-Forwarded-For` (`$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`) and `X-Forwarded-Proto`
  (`$scheme`) headers in both API location blocks (added as part of item #3).

**Remaining consideration:** `--forwarded-allow-ips='*'` on uvicorn (or the
specific proxy IP) to trust the forwarded headers. Within Docker Compose, the
nginx container's IP is dynamic, so `'*'` is acceptable since nginx is the
only upstream. Without this, uvicorn ignores the forwarded headers.

---

### 9. ~~SECRET_KEY with environment validation~~ PARTIALLY DONE

**Done:** `SECRET_KEY: str` is a required field in `config.py` (no default —
startup fails if missing). Used by Starlette `SessionMiddleware` to sign
session cookies. `.env.example` documents the field with a generation command.

**Remaining:** Add a `model_validator` to `Settings` that rejects weak values
in production:

```python
@model_validator(mode="after")
def _validate_secrets(self) -> Self:
    if self.ENVIRONMENT == "production":
        weak = {"changethis", "secret", "password", ""}
        if self.SECRET_KEY in weak or len(self.SECRET_KEY) < 32:
            raise ValueError(
                "SECRET_KEY must be a random string of at least 32 characters "
                "in production. Generate one with: "
                "python -c \"import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))\""
            )
        if self.POSTGRES_PASSWORD in weak:
            raise ValueError("POSTGRES_PASSWORD is too weak for production")
    return self
```

---

## MEDIUM

### 10. Network segmentation in Docker Compose

**Current state:** All services share the default Docker Compose bridge network.
The frontend (nginx) container can directly reach the PostgreSQL container.

**Problem:** If the nginx container is compromised (e.g., via a vulnerability in
nginx itself), the attacker has direct network access to the database.

**Fix:**

```yaml
services:
  db:
    networks: [backend]

  prestart:
    networks: [backend]

  backend:
    networks: [backend, frontend]

  frontend:
    networks: [frontend]

networks:
  backend:
    internal: true   # no external access at all
  frontend:
```

The `internal: true` flag on the backend network means even if a container on
that network is compromised, it cannot make outbound connections to the internet
(except through the backend, which has access to both networks).

---

### 11. Bind development ports to localhost

**Current state:** `compose.override.yml` exposes ports as `"5432:5432"`,
`"8000:8000"`, `"5173:80"` — bound to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces).

**Problem:** On a machine connected to any network (coffee shop, hotel, shared
WiFi), the database, backend, and frontend are accessible to anyone on the same
network. Docker port mappings bypass host firewalls (UFW, iptables).

**Fix:** Prefix all dev ports with `127.0.0.1:`:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    ports: ["127.0.0.1:5432:5432"]
  backend:
    ports: ["127.0.0.1:8000:8000"]
  frontend:
    ports: ["127.0.0.1:5173:80"]
```

---

### 12. Read-only container filesystems

**Current state:** All containers have read-write root filesystems.

**Problem:** If an attacker gains code execution inside a container, they can
modify any file (binaries, configs, scripts). A read-only filesystem means
malware or backdoors cannot be persisted inside the container.

**Fix:**

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:size=500M
      - /run:size=10M
    volumes:
      - app-data:/app/backend/data   # already exists — the only writable path

  frontend:
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:size=50M
      - /var/cache/nginx:size=200M
      - /run:size=10M

  db:
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:size=100M
      - /var/run/postgresql:size=10M
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata   # already exists
```

Note: Playwright needs write access for its browser profile. The backend's
`/tmp` tmpfs handles this since Playwright uses temp directories. Test
thoroughly after enabling.

---

### 13. Per-user storage quota

**Current state:** Each upload extracts a full Polarsteps export to
`data/users/<uid>/`. There is no tracking of disk usage per user and no limit
on total storage consumed. Temp directory cleanup on extraction failure IS
implemented (`extract_and_scan` wraps extraction in try/except with
`shutil.rmtree`; `upload_data` also cleans up the temp folder if the DB
commit or folder rename fails).

**Problem:** A single user (or attacker) can upload repeatedly, each time
consuming hundreds of MB.

**Fix:**

1. **Track user storage** — add a computed or cached field:
   ```python
   def disk_usage(self) -> int:
       """Total bytes used by this user's data directory."""
       return sum(f.stat().st_size for f in self.folder.rglob("*") if f.is_file())
   ```

2. **Enforce a quota** before accepting new uploads:
   ```python
   MAX_USER_STORAGE = 500 * 1024 * 1024  # 500 MB
   ```

3. ~~**Clean up temp directories**~~ — DONE. Both `extract_and_scan()` in
   `upload.py` and `upload_data()` in `users.py` clean up temp directories
   on failure.

4. **Global storage limit** — check total disk usage of `USERS_FOLDER` and reject
   uploads when the server is running low (e.g., < 1 GB free).

---

### 14. Validate extracted file types after ZIP extraction

**Current state:** After `_safe_extract()` (in `upload.py`), the code reads
`user.json` and iterates trip directories, trusting that the ZIP contains only
expected file types (JSON, JPEG, MP4). `_safe_extract` already rejects symlinks
during extraction (via `external_attr` check) and blocks path traversal, but
does not validate individual file types.

**Problem:** A crafted ZIP could contain executable files, HTML files with
embedded scripts, or other unexpected content. These files are then served by
the `get_media` endpoint or processed by ffmpeg/Pillow.

**Fix:**

After extraction, walk the directory and:
1. Verify every file is one of the expected types (`.json`, `.jpg`, `.mp4`)
   using both extension AND magic bytes.
2. Delete or reject any unexpected files.
3. ~~Verify no symlinks exist in the extracted tree~~ — DONE. Symlinks are
   rejected during extraction by `_safe_extract()` in `upload.py`.

```python
import magic

ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {".json", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".mp4"}

def _validate_extracted_files(folder: Path) -> None:
    for path in folder.rglob("*"):
        if path.is_symlink():
            raise ValueError(f"Symlink not allowed: {path.name}")
        if path.is_file() and path.suffix.lower() not in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS:
            path.unlink()
            logger.warning("Removed unexpected file: %s", path.name)
```

---

### 15. Weak default database password

**Current state:** `.env.example:30` has `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres`. The actual
`.env` (not in git, but on disk) also uses `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres`.

**Problem:** While the DB is not exposed to the internet in production compose
(no port mapping), this is still a weak credential. If network segmentation is
incomplete, or if the compose config is accidentally modified, the DB is wide
open.

**Fix:**

1. Change `.env.example` to:
   ```
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changethis
   ```
2. Add validation in `Settings._validate_secrets` (item #9) that rejects weak
   DB passwords in production.
3. In the actual `.env`, generate a random password:
   ```bash
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(24))"
   ```

---

### 16. CORS methods and headers too broad

**Current state:** `main.py:54-55` sets `allow_methods=["*"]` and
`allow_headers=["*"]`.

**Problem:** While this is common in single-frontend setups, it allows methods
like `CONNECT`, `TRACE`, `OPTIONS` to non-preflight requests from the listed
origins. Automated scanners flag this.

**Fix:**

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=settings.all_cors_origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PATCH", "DELETE"],
    allow_headers=["Content-Type"],
)
```

---

### 17. Cookie `path` scope too broad

**Current state:** Starlette `SessionMiddleware` sets the `session` cookie
with no `path` parameter, defaulting to `/` — sent on every request including
static asset requests to nginx.

**Fix:** Starlette's `SessionMiddleware` does not support a `path` parameter
natively. Options:
1. Accept the `/` default — the cookie is small (signed JSON with only `uid`)
   and the overhead is negligible.
2. Subclass `SessionMiddleware` to add `path="/api"` — adds complexity for
   minimal gain.

Given the cookie contains no PII and is small, this is low priority.

---

### 18. PDF temp files not cleaned up on server restart

**Current state:** `pdf.py:62` stores download tokens in an in-memory dict
`_tokens`. Tokens have a 5-minute TTL via `call_later`. When the server
restarts, all pending tokens are lost — but the temp files on disk remain
forever.

**Problem:** Over time, orphaned PDF temp files accumulate in `/tmp`, consuming
disk.

**Fix:**

1. Write PDF temp files to a dedicated directory (e.g., `data/pdf-tmp/`) instead
   of the system `/tmp`.
2. On startup (in the `lifespan` function), delete all files in that directory
   older than `_TOKEN_TTL` seconds.
3. Add a periodic cleanup task (or just clean on every new PDF generation).

```python
PDF_TMP_DIR = settings.DATA_FOLDER / "pdf-tmp"

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    PDF_TMP_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    # Clean stale PDFs from previous runs
    for f in PDF_TMP_DIR.iterdir():
        if f.is_file():
            f.unlink()
    ...
```

---

## LOW

### 19. HTTPS termination

**Current state:** Nginx listens on port 80 only. No TLS. No redirect from
HTTP to HTTPS.

**Problem:** All traffic (including the session cookie, user data, uploaded
files) is transmitted in plaintext. The `secure` cookie flag (item #1) won't
work without HTTPS. Cloud VMs are often on shared networks where traffic
sniffing is possible.

**Fix (choose one):**

- **Option A: Cloud load balancer** — if deploying to AWS/GCP/Azure, use their
  managed load balancer with a free TLS certificate. Nginx stays on port 80
  internally. The load balancer handles TLS and forwards to nginx.
- **Option B: Certbot + nginx** — install certbot, obtain a Let's Encrypt
  certificate, configure nginx to serve on 443 with the cert and redirect 80→443.
- **Option C: Traefik** — replace nginx with Traefik as the reverse proxy.
  Traefik auto-provisions Let's Encrypt certificates. This is what the FastAPI
  full-stack template uses.

Add `Strict-Transport-Security` header (already in item #4) only after HTTPS
is working.

---

### 20. Ruff security rules (flake8-bandit)

**Current state:** `pyproject.toml` already selects `ALL` rules for Ruff, which
includes the `S` (flake8-bandit) prefix. These rules ARE already active. However,
there is no CI enforcement or pre-commit hook ensuring they stay passing.

**Fix:**

1. Verify current compliance — run `ruff check --select S backend/app/` and fix
   any findings.
2. Add `ruff check` to CI (GitHub Actions) so security regressions block merges.
3. Consider adding a pre-commit hook:
   ```yaml
   # .pre-commit-config.yaml
   - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
     rev: v0.11.0
     hooks:
       - id: ruff
         args: [--fix]
       - id: ruff-format
   ```

---

### 21. Dependency vulnerability scanning

**Current state:** No automated scanning for known CVEs in Python or JavaScript
dependencies. `dependabot.yml` may exist in `.github/` but no CI job runs
`pip-audit` or `npm audit`.

**Problem:** Vulnerable dependencies (especially `python-multipart`, `Pillow`,
`playwright`, `uvicorn`) could have known exploits that are trivially scriptable.

**Fix:**

1. **Python** — add `pip-audit` to dev dependencies and CI:
   ```bash
   uv run pip-audit
   ```

2. **JavaScript** — add to CI:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && bun audit
   ```
   (Or `npx audit-ci --critical` for a CI-friendly wrapper.)

3. **Docker images** — add Trivy scanning to CI:
   ```bash
   trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 backend:latest
   trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --exit-code 1 frontend:latest
   ```

4. **GitHub Dependabot** — ensure `.github/dependabot.yml` covers both `pip`
   (uv) and `npm` (bun) ecosystems.

---

### 22. Semgrep static analysis

**Current state:** No SAST tool beyond Ruff's S rules.

**Fix:** Add Semgrep to CI for deeper, framework-aware analysis:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
- name: Semgrep SAST
  uses: semgrep/semgrep-action@v1
  with:
    config: >
      p/python
      p/owasp-top-ten
```

Semgrep understands FastAPI's dependency injection, Pydantic model validation,
and SQLAlchemy query patterns — it catches things Ruff/Bandit miss.

---

### 23. Docker image scanning with Trivy

**Current state:** No container image scanning.

**Fix:** Add to CI:

```yaml
- name: Build backend image
  run: docker build -t backend:${{ github.sha }} -f backend/Dockerfile .

- name: Trivy scan backend
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: backend:${{ github.sha }}
    severity: CRITICAL,HIGH
    exit-code: 1

- name: Trivy scan Dockerfiles
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    scan-type: config
    scan-ref: .
    severity: CRITICAL,HIGH
```

Also run locally during development:
```bash
trivy config backend/Dockerfile
trivy config frontend/Dockerfile
trivy config compose.yml
```

---

### 24. Timestamp validation on ffmpeg extract_frame

**Current state:** `media.py:132` accepts `timestamp: float` from the user via
query parameter and passes it to ffmpeg as `-ss str(timestamp)`. While
`create_subprocess_exec` prevents shell injection, there's no validation of the
float value.

**Problem:** `NaN`, `inf`, `-inf`, or very large negative values could cause
ffmpeg to hang or behave unexpectedly.

**Fix:**

```python
@router.patch("/{aid}/media/{name}")
async def update_video_frame(
    aid: str, name: MediaName, user: UserDep,
    timestamp: Annotated[float, Query(ge=0, le=86400)],
) -> None:
    ...
```

This uses FastAPI's built-in validation to reject values outside 0–86400 seconds
(24 hours — no video is longer than that in a Polarsteps export).

---

### 25. Error response information leakage

**Current state:** The `NoResultFound` exception handler in `main.py:73` returns
a generic "Not Found". However, unhandled exceptions produce FastAPI's default
500 response which includes the exception type and message.

**Fix:** Add a catch-all exception handler for production:

```python
if settings.ENVIRONMENT == "production":
    @app.exception_handler(Exception)
    async def _generic_error(_request: Request, exc: Exception) -> PlainTextResponse:
        logger.exception("Unhandled exception")
        return PlainTextResponse("Internal Server Error", status_code=500)
```

This ensures stack traces and internal details never leak to clients in
production, while preserving them in development.

---

### 26. Mapbox token scope verification

**Current state:** `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` in `.env` is a public token (`pk.` prefix)
baked into the frontend at build time.

**Problem:** Public Mapbox tokens are designed to be visible in browsers, but
without URL restrictions on the Mapbox dashboard, anyone can copy the token and
use it on their own site, consuming the account's quota.

**Fix:**

1. Log into Mapbox Studio → Account → Access tokens.
2. Edit the token and add URL restrictions to only allow requests from your
   production domain.
3. Consider creating separate tokens for development (unrestricted, low quota)
   and production (URL-restricted).

This is a Mapbox dashboard change, not a code change.

---

### 27. ~~Session invalidation on user deletion~~ DONE

**Implemented:** `users.py:delete_user` deletes the user from the DB and calls
`request.session.clear()`, which removes the signed session cookie. The
`auth.py:logout` endpoint also calls `request.session.clear()`.

The frontend also invalidates all Pinia Colada query caches on sign-out and
user deletion (`UserMenu.vue` calls `cache.invalidateQueries()`), preventing
stale user data from being shown after re-login with a different account.

Other sessions (other browsers) will get 401 on next request because
`deps.py:_get_user` does a DB lookup — the user no longer exists. The session
cookie payload (`{"uid": N}`) is harmless since the uid resolves to nothing.

---

### 28. ~~Playwright Chromium sandboxing~~ DONE

**Implemented:** Added `--no-sandbox` to Chromium launch args as part of
item #5 (non-root containers). The container itself is the sandbox — Chromium's
internal sandbox is redundant when the process is already non-root and
capability-restricted.

**File:** `backend/app/main.py`

---

### 29. Concurrent upload / processing abuse

**Current state:** The `process_user` SSE endpoint (`users.py:115`) and PDF
generation (`pdf.py`) are long-running operations. The PDF endpoint has a
semaphore (`_pdf_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(1)`) limiting concurrency to 1,
but `process_user` has no such limit.

**Problem:** An attacker can open many SSE connections to `/api/v1/users/process`,
each triggering ffprobe/ffmpeg/Pillow processing. This exhausts CPU and memory.

**Fix:**

1. Add a semaphore to `process_user` (or limit via slowapi).
2. Check if the user already has an active processing stream before starting a
   new one.
3. The nginx rate limiting from item #3 provides the first line of defense.

---

### 30. Frontend: audit v-html usage

**Current state:** Vue 3 auto-escapes `{{ }}` interpolations, but `v-html`
renders raw HTML. If any component uses `v-html` with user-supplied data
(trip descriptions, step names, etc.), it's an XSS vector.

**Fix:**

1. Search the frontend for all `v-html` usage:
   ```bash
   grep -r "v-html" frontend/src/
   ```
2. For each usage, verify the source is either:
   - Static/trusted content, OR
   - Sanitized through DOMPurify before rendering.
3. If any `v-html` uses user-supplied data, either replace with `{{ }}` (text
   interpolation) or add DOMPurify:
   ```typescript

## Summary: implementation order

The items are numbered by severity, but the recommended implementation order
accounts for dependencies between items. Items marked ~~struck~~ are done.

1. ~~**#9** SECRET_KEY setting (dependency for #1)~~ — DONE (field added, no production validator yet)
2. ~~**#1** Signed cookie (depends on #9)~~ — DONE (Google OAuth2 + SessionMiddleware)
3. ~~**#2** Upload size limit~~ — DONE (3-layer: frontend `max-file-size`, nginx `client_max_body_size`, backend seek check; `VITE_MAX_UPLOAD_GB` env var)
4. ~~**#3** Rate limiting (nginx)~~ — DONE (two per-IP zones: `uploads` 1r/m, `general` 10r/s; 429 on excess)
5. ~~**#4** Security headers~~ — DONE (CSP, X-Frame-Options, MIME sniff, referrer, permissions; shared snippet)
6. ~~**#8** Proxy headers~~ — DONE (uvicorn `--proxy-headers` + nginx `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Forwarded-Proto`)
7. ~~**#5** Non-root containers~~ — DONE (backend: `appuser`, frontend: `nginx` on port 8080)
8. ~~**#7** Docker security_opt + cap_drop + resource limits~~ — DONE (no-new-privileges, cap_drop ALL, read_only, resource limits, pids_limit, shm_size, init)
9. ~~**#6** MIME validation~~ — DONE (puremagic: ZIP magic bytes pre-extraction + inner file type check post-extraction)
10. **#10** Network segmentation
11. **#11** Localhost-bind dev ports
12. **#12** Read-only filesystems
13. **#13** Storage quotas
14. **#14** Validate extracted files
15. **#15** Strong DB password
16. **#16** CORS lockdown
17. **#17** Cookie path scope (low priority — cookie is small, no PII)
18. **#18** PDF temp cleanup
19. **#24** Timestamp validation
20. **#25** Error response handler
21. **#19** HTTPS termination
22. **#20** Ruff CI enforcement
